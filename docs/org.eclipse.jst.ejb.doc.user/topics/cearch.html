<h1 class="topictitle1">EJB architecture</h1>
<div><p>This topic provides a high-level overview of the distributed component
architecture defined in the Sun Microsystems Enterprise JavaBeans™ (EJB)
architecture specification.</p>
<p>The complete Enterprise JavaBeans specifications and descriptions
of the technology are available from the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/ejb/docs.html#specs" target="_blank">java.sun.com</a> Web site.</p>
<p>Enterprise beans provide several benefits for application developers: </p>
<ul><li>They allow you to build distributed applications by combining components
developed using tools from different vendors. </li>
<li>They make it easy to write applications. You do not have to deal with
low-level details of transaction and state management, multithreading, resource
pooling, and other complex low-level APIs. However, if necessary, expert programmers
can still gain direct access to the low-level APIs.</li>
<li>They can be developed once and then deployed on multiple platforms without
recompilation or source code modification. </li>
<li>The EJB specification that governs the use of enterprise beans is compatible
with other Java™ APIs and CORBA. It also provides for interoperability
between enterprise beans and non-Java applications.</li>
</ul>
<dl><dt class="dlterm">Enterprise beans</dt>
<dd>An <em>enterprise bean</em> is a non-visual component of a distributed,
transaction-oriented enterprise application. Enterprise beans are typically
deployed in EJB containers and run on EJB servers. You can customize them
by changing their deployment descriptors and you can assemble them with other
beans to create new applications. There are three types of enterprise beans: <em>session
beans</em>, <em>entity beans</em>, and <em>message-driven</em> beans.<div class="p"><blockquote> <ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Session beans</span>: <em>Session beans</em> are non-persistent
enterprise beans. They can be stateful or stateless. A <em>stateful session
bean</em> acts on behalf of a single client and maintains client-specific session
information (called conversational state) across multiple method calls and
transactions. It exists for the duration of a single client/server session.
A <em>stateless session bean</em>, by comparison, does not maintain any conversational
state. Stateless session beans are pooled by their container to handle multiple
requests from multiple clients.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Entity beans</span>: <em>Entity beans</em> are enterprise
beans that contain persistent data and that can be saved in various persistent
data stores. Each entity bean carries its own identity. Entity beans that
manage their own persistence are called <em>bean-managed persistence (BMP)
 entity beans</em>. Entity beans that delegate their persistence to their EJB
container are called <em>container-managed persistence (CMP) entity beans</em>.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Message-driven beans</span>: <em>Message-driven beans</em> are
enterprise beans that receive and process JMS messages. Unlike session or
entity beans, message-driven beans have no interfaces. They can be accessed
only through messaging and they do not maintain any conversational state.
 Message-driven beans allow asynchronous communication between the queue and
the listener, and provide separation between message processing and business
logic.</li>
</ul>

</dl>
<dl><dt class="dlterm">Remote client view</dt>
<dd>The <em>remote client view</em> specification became available beginning
with EJB 1.1. The remote client view of an enterprise bean is location independent.
A client running in the same JVM as a bean instance uses the same API to access
the bean as a client running in a different JVM on the same or different machine.<ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Remote interface</span>: The <em>remote interface</em> specifies
the remote business methods that a client can call on an enterprise bean.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Remote home interface</span>: The <em>remote home interface</em> specifies
the methods used by remote clients for locating, creating, and removing instances
of enterprise bean classes.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl><dt class="dlterm">Local client view</dt>
<dd>The <em>local client view</em> specification is available in EJB 2.0 or
later. Unlike the remote client view, the local client view of a bean is location
dependent. Local client view access to an enterprise bean requires both the
local client and the enterprise bean that provides the local client view to
be in the same JVM. The local client view therefore does not provide the location
transparency provided by the remote client view. Local interfaces and local
home interfaces provide support for lightweight access from enterprise bean
that are local clients. Session and entity beans can be tightly couple with
their clients, allowing access without the overhead typically associated with
remote method calls.<ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Local interface</span>: The <em>local interface</em> is
a lightweight version of the remote interface, but for local clients. It includes
business logic methods that can be called by a local client.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Local home interface</span>: The <em>local home interface</em> specifies
the methods used by local clients for locating, creating, and removing instances
of enterprise bean classes.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt class="dlterm">Web service client view</dt>
<dd>In the EJB 2.1 specification, the EJB architecture introduced the support
for Web services. A client for a session bean can be a Web service client.
A Web service client can make use of the Web service client view of a stateless
session bean, which has a corresponding service endpoint interface.<dl><dt class="dlterm">Service endpoint interface</dt>
<dd>The <em>service endpoint interface</em> for a stateless session bean exposes
the functionality of the session bean as a Web service endpoint. The Web Service
Description Language (WSDL) document for a Web service describes the Web service
as a set of endpoints operating on messages. A WSDL document can include the
service endpoint interface of a stateless session bean as one of its endpoints.
An existing stateless session bean can be modified to include a Web service
client view, or a service endpoint interface can be mapped from an existing
WSDL to provide the correct interface.<p>A Web service client view is independent
of location and can be accessed through remote calls.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl><dt class="dlterm">EJB client JAR file</dt>
<dd>An EJB client JAR file is an optional JAR file that can contain the client
interfaces that a client program needs to use the client views of the enterprise
beans that are contained in the EJB JAR file. If you decide not to create
an EJB client JAR file for an EJB module, all of the client interface classes
will be in the EJB JAR file. By default, the workbench creates EJB client
JAR projects for each corresponding EJB project.</dd>
</dl>
<dl><dt class="dlterm">EJB container</dt>
<dd>An <em>EJB container</em> is a runtime environment that manages one or more
enterprise beans. The EJB container manages the life cycles of enterprise
bean objects, coordinates distributed transactions, and implements object
security. Generally, each EJB container is provided by an EJB server and contains
a set of enterprise beans that run on the server.</dd>
<dt class="dlterm">Deployment descriptor</dt>
<dd>A <em>deployment descriptor</em> is an XML file packaged with the enterprise
beans in an EJB JAR file or an EAR file. It contains metadata describing the
contents and structure of the enterprise beans, and runtime transaction and
security information for the EJB container.</dd>
<dt class="dlterm">EJB server</dt>
<dd>An <em>EJB server</em> is a high-level process or application that provides
a runtime environment to support the execution of server applications that
use enterprise beans. An EJB server provides a JNDI-accessible naming service,
manages and coordinates the allocation of resources to client applications,
provides access to system resources, and provides a transaction service. An
EJB server could be provided by, for example, a database or application server.</dd>
