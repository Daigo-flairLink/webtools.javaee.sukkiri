<h1 class="topictitle1">Exporting EJB projects to EJB JAR files</h1>
<div><p>After you have tested your enterprise beans, you can export the
module into an EJB JAR file.</p>
<div class="section"><p>When you export an EJB module, or project, the contents of the
project are exported into an EJB JAR file regardless of whether deployment
code has been generated or not. You can use the exported server-side JAR file
as the client JAR file, since it contains all of the required code from both
a server-side and client-side perspective.</p>
<div class="important" id="teexp__exportEJBClientJAR"><a name="teexp__exportEJBClientJAR"><!-- --></a><span class="importanttitle">Important: </span>If you use the Export EJB JAR file wizard to export an EJB
project, the export wizard does not include an EJB project's associated EJB
client JAR project. To include the EJB client JAR file, it is recommended
that you export the enterprise application EAR file that contains the EJB
project. The resulting EAR file will include any dependent EJB client JAR
files as utility JAR files. Alternatively, you can export the EJB client JAR
project separately as a JAR file.</div>
<p>To export an EJB project:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="stepexpand"><span>In the Project Explorer view of the J2EE perspective, right-click
the EJB module that you want to export.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Select <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Export</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">EJB
JAR file</span></span> from the pop-up menu. The Export wizard
opens.</span> </li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Select the EJB module to export from the drop-down list.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Destination</span> field, provide the full
path and JAR file name for the exported EJB module.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><strong>Optional: </strong><span>To include source files in the exported JAR
file, select the <span class="uicontrol">Export source files</span> check box.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><strong>Optional: </strong><span>If you are exporting to an existing JAR file
and you do not want to be warned about overwriting it, select <span class="uicontrol">Overwrite
existing files without warning</span></span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="section"> <p>To deploy your EJB JAR file to an application server after you
export it, you need to use the deployment tools provided by the vendor of
that server.</p>
