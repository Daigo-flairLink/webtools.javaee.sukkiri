<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating Message-driven Beans</h1>



<div>
<p>You can use a wizard to create a message-driven bean and add it to your
project.</p>

<p>The message-driven bean wizard helps you create an Enterprise message-driven bean by
walking you through the creation process and by providing you with
output files that you can use or that you can modify for use with your
application.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>To create a message-driven bean, complete the following steps:</p>
</div>

<ol>
	<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the Java EE perspective,
	expand your EJB project in the Project Explorer view.</span></li>

	<li class="stepexpand"><span>Right click on the <strong>Message-Driven
	Bean</strong> icon, and select <span class="menucascade"> <span
		class="uicontrol">New</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Message-Driven
	Bean</span></span> from the pop-up menu.</span> The <span class="uicontrol">Create
	Message-Driven Bean</span> wizard appears.</li>

	<li class="stepexpand"><span>Follow the project wizard
	prompts.</span></li>

</ol>

<p><strong>General Information</strong></p>
<dl>
	<dt class="dlterm"><b>Destination name</b></dt>


	<dd>This field provides the attribute <b>mappedName</b> to the <b>@MessageDriven</b>
	annotation. This attribute specifies the product-specific name to which
	the message-driven bean should be mapped. You can also use this
	attribute to specify the JNDI name of the destination from
	which the bean will consume messages.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt class="dlterm"><strong>Destination type</strong></dt>

	<dd>To send a JMS message, we need a connection to the JMS
	provider and a destination address for the message. A JMS connection
	factory makes the connection to the provider possible. In JMS, messages
	are not sent directly to applications; they are sent to topics or queues:
	<div class="p">
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Queue:</strong><br />
		Queue is used as a destination for point–to–point messaging. The <b>point-to-point</b>
		messaging model allows JMS clients to send and receive messages both
		synchronously and asynchronously via virtual channels known as <i>queues</i>.
		The p2p messaging model has traditionally been a pull- or
		polling-based model, where messages are requested from the queue
		instead of being pushed to the client automatically. A queue may have
		multiple receivers, but only one receiver may receive each message.
		Messages holding this queue are of <b>MapMessages</b> type, which stores
		the information about the email as name/value pair.</li>
		<li><strong>Topic:</strong><br />
		Topic is used as a destination for publish/subscribe messaging. In <b>publish-and-subscribe</b>
		messaging, one producer can send a message to many consumers through a
		virtual channel called a <i>topic</i>. Consumers can choose to subscribe to a
		topic. Any messages addressed to a topic are delivered to all the
		topic's consumers. Every consumer receives a copy of each message. The
		pub/sub messaging model is a push-based model, where
		messages are automatically broadcast to consumers without them having
		to request or poll the topic for new messages. In the pub/sub messaging
		model, the producer sending the message is not dependent on the
		consumers receiving the message. Optionally, JMS clients that use
		pub/sub can establish durable subscriptions that allow consumers to
		disconnect and later reconnect and collect messages that were
		published while they were disconnected.</li>

	</ul>
	</div>
	</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt class="dlterm"><b>Transaction type</b></dt>

	<dd>The <b>Transaction type</b> field is used to specify
	whether the transaction is handled by the <b>Container</b> or the <b>Bean</b>.</dd>
</dl>



<dl>
	<dt class="dlterm"><strong>Interfaces</strong></dt>

	<dd>Message-driven beans usually implement the <b>javax.jms.MessageListener</b>
	interface. A <i>MessageListener</i> object is used to receive
	asynchronously delivered messages. This interface defines the <b>onMessage()</b>
	method. This method processes the JMS messages received by a bean.</dd>
